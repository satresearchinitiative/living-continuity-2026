      "content": "In the last three decades, the preservation and adaptive reuse of Sharjah historical buildings and urban fragments have shifted from an emphasis on historical and cultural attributes of buildings, to the valuation of use and social and environmental benefits. The three public institutions that have operated in this field: Sharjah Heritage Department, Sharjah Art Foundation, and Sharjah Architecture Triennial cover the above spectrum of preservation interests. The paper will examine various approaches to conservation through four related case studies of urban fragments and buildings repurposed between 1990 and 2020.  The first section  focuses on adaptive reuse as a strategy to conserve architecture heritage, a value that is adopted by Sharjah Heritage Department in its conservation of Sharjah historical core. The second section tackles the related question of the interpretation of the past showing how two institutions, Sharjah Heritage Department and Sharjah Art Foundation that operate in the same historical area, offer opposing interpretations of the past hence quite different strategies of preservation. The third section discusses the shift towards considering use as the main valuation of adaptive reuse, an approach adapted by Sharjah Architecture Triennial in its renovation of Al Qasimiyah school, in Al Manakh neighborhood. The fourth section simply argues that adaptive reuse supports the re-evaluation and transformation of architecture, and in turn supports sustainable urban development.<a href='https://www.sharjaharchitecture.org/research#' target='_blank'>Read more</a>"

      "content": "The Simpson's episode titled Trash of the Titans begins with Homer Simpson getting into a heated argument with Springfield's sanitation governor, Ray Patterson, and decides to run for the office. Together with his friend Moe, Homer comes up with the campaign slogan 'Can't someone else do it?'('The Simpsons', 1998). At his subsequent rally Homer points out how nobody likes dealing with their own garbage. 'Ray Patterson thinks you should do it!' He exclaimed 'Did we lose a war? This isn't America!' At the end of his passionate speech he asked the crowd 'Who should handle all your trash?' The people cheered and chanted 'Someone else! Someone else!' Homer won the election by an overwhelming majority vote. ('The Simpsons', 1998) Homer's antics in this episode make us face our absurd realities when it comes to the daily treatment of sanitation workers. Their labour, while pivotal to the city's infrastructure, remains largely invisible to the everyday operations of the city. This leads to a process of othering experienced by the workers due to their closeness to discarded material and can be witnessed in the Simpsons when the crowd starts referring to the workers as 'someone else'. The sanitation worker as someone else is a social condition documented throughout history. Seventeenth century French writer, Victor Hugo, highlighted the sewers as reflection of social order when he wrote 'The sewer is the conscience of the city. All things converge and confront one another there… All the filthiness of civilization, once out of commission, falls into this pit of truth where the immense social slippage ends up'(Reid, 1991: 21). For him and his contemporaries, the sewer represented a social threshold where ungoverned populations convened at a time when revolutions ran rampant. The sewer provided a refuge to the people who plotted against authorities and came to represent a space of crime. This criminalization of space in turn defined its primary users: The sewage workers as an unruly and ungoverned group of people. The workers' proximity to discarded materials in the space of the sewer thus generated social anxiety. These anxieties defined social orders and enabled bureaucratic interventions as well as the need for enhanced surveillance (Reid, 1991: 20). While many authors expressed an immense disdain for the sewage system, nobody could question  its pivotal role in the day to day operations of the city. This unique position, between the central as well as the marginal, means that strict regulations had to be implemented to differentiate between the bodies of those who produce waste versus those who remove waste. This process is defined by the many social conditions that regulate the flow of the environment. Efficient flow of discarded materials and fluids is crucial in understanding the infrastructure of sanitation as well as the subsequent treatment of its workers. Waste disposal forms a social institution that globally generates varying conditions informed by its own unique context. Every culture defines its concepts of clean and unclean within a local discourse of toxicity. Ethnic and racial biases along with religious and social customs that weave together to define the 'other'(Reid, 1991: 88). <a href='https://www.sharjaharchitecture.org/research#' target='_blank'>Read more</a>"

      "content": "\"Practice-place and space: narrations of urban memories and belonging\"- 'Nihil de nobis, sine nobis'. This essay is about a city and its inhabitants creating spaces of identity and belonging. Through five sections, we will discuss how inhabitants perform practices in different urban spaces in the Emirate of Sharjah. First, we will introduce the concept of the city as a \"category of practice\", as it offers the opportunity to observe people's relationship to urbanisation processes in the context of study. Subsequently, we will present the concepts of practice and space-place as mediums to exhibit inner realities (interventions) that describe how things interact and coordinate in the micro-scale realm while manifesting external realities that become part of the cultural identity and visual discourse of the urban landscape of the Emirate of Sharjah. We also examine how these concepts become instruments for inhabitants to create a sense of belonging and develop urban memories. But above all, how practice-place-space represents a set of relations and tensions that highlight challenges and opportunities about representation, plural views, and knowledge production in people's collective memory. The third section discusses the need for anticipating intended and potential unintended impacts when designing interventions in the city. We consider essential to reflect on our roles, positioning and privilege when researching and designing within complex systems. Hence, we addressed a series of questions for our observations to reduce biases in describing practices. We recognized that our observations require input from the individuals pursuing practices to understand their rituals. The fourth section has three observations from different individuals documenting three practices in diverse locations in the Emirate of Sharjah to exhibit the risks of not integrating the observed voice. In the conclusions, we reflected on how the observations are biased as they exhibit how the observer knows the world and what it looks from their worldview. We argued the need for an approach towards reflecting the underlying purposes, motivations and potential impacts of observations and interventions. The design process should include and respond to those individuals affected by our interventions and, thus, our decisions. Ergo, we introduce a series of guiding questions for decision-makers and the public to inform their practice. This exercise is relevant to critique interpretations of practice-space-place and the city and to reduce the privileged and maintained discourse that might delegitimize others' discourses. <a href='https://www.sharjaharchitecture.org/research#' target='_blank'>Read more link</a>"

      "content": "Caught between SZR and Al Seef \"Not yet.\" In 2022, I asked an Indian colleague, who lives in Meena Bazaar, Bur Dubai, if there's any redevelopment happening in the vicinity. A casual inquiry amid small talk. Her reply came quickly with raised eyebrows, \"Not yet.\" There seems to exist a looming awareness, among middle-class residents of older buildings in Dubai's downtown neighborhoods (Deira, Bur Dubai, Karama & Satwa), that a new city is inevitable. A pen dipping into ink, ready to write over the backdrop of their lives. It's a well-founded fear; the older neighborhoods of Dubai, affordable spaces for middle class South and Southeast Asians for over fifty years, are undergoing massive transformation and physical redevelopment. Much of Satwa has been razed and  replaced by new Meraas developments.  The Deira Enrichment Project has altered large parts of Deira beyond recognition since 2017. Redevelopment in Karama has picked up significant pace since 2015, with rent in new buildings being 42% higher than in older buildings.  The latest in this trajectory of urban 'regeneration' is the 2021 announcement of the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan. One of the aims of this plan is to \"revitalize\" the neighborhoods of Deira and Bur Dubai, two neighborhoods that still offer affordable housing in the center of Dubai, connected to public transport. This is in the context of fewer affordable living alternatives for middle class dwellers in Dubai. A 2018 study of Dubai's land use policy shows that there is a \"lack of sufficient affordable housing units for the middle-class population; rental figures for this group are at crisis point. Only 23% of total housing units, which corresponds to a mere 7% of the total housing floor area in Dubai, are affordable for this group.\" The transformation of these neighborhoods does not happen simply through direct changes in the built environment: redevelopment, inflation and evictions. Physical redevelopment is fed by and feeds cultural expulsion in a now-smooth choreography. Cultural expulsions encapsulate an erasure of existing modes of living and being that support community, organic to the neighborhood, and a rewriting of a space's narrative through redevelopment and adjacent projects. I argue that beyond physical displacement for these communities, who may be forced to move out of their neighborhood, the city, or even the country, there is a larger erasure at stake: a rewriting of how the city came to be and who was involved. Through tourism advertisements, media images, and narratives of wealth, prosperity, and consumer freedom, state-aligned actors and businesses have curated an image of Dubai with two components, which are productive for capital: \"modern\" (read luxurious, convenient, and consumable) and \"traditional\" (read Emirati, and Arab). Solidified and packaged for marketing on the global stage, Dubai has positioned itself as the ideal place to live, work, and visit for the world's upwardly mobile, wealthy, and resourceful, skewed towards citizens of the Global North with already-powerful passports.  As we witness more part-fictional reconstructions of the past like Al Seef, and the old-looking new souq in Deira (part of the Deira Enrichment Project), the stories of neighborhoods like Bur Dubai, Deira, Satwa, and Karama are under threat of being reduced to glimpses of old souks and dhows, with its residential, non-consumable, and transnational components rendered largely invisible. Since Dubai depends quite heavily on foreign direct investment and tourism for its sources of income, the Brand Dubai narrative needs to consistently reflect certainty, clarity and profitability. These requirements barely leave room for the type of complex, messy historical cosmopolitanism housed in these neighborhoods. What is also at stake is the well-being of the remaining residents of these neighborhoods and their quality of life. My colleague in Bur Dubai displayed an affective unsettling: a sense of precarity she holds, even while three generations of her family have lived in the same building. The impact of cultural expulsion is a sense of forced un-belonging, similar to what Dr. Khaled AlAwadi calls \"an atmosphere of uncertainty that itself constitutes a form of psychological violence.\"  This is especially significant in a city and country where in the absence of accessible legal citizenship, long-time South Asian residents have used narratives, historical memory, and shared identity to bind themselves to Dubai.  Cultural expulsion erases the physical traces of this history in Dubai and transforms the sites where culture, through the lived continuity of South Asian expatriates, has sedimented. The resulting sense of forced un-belonging makes the population of older neighborhoods more prone to displacement, as <a href='' target='_blank'>Read more</a>"
