"content": "How can we learn from weeds the art of surviving in the margins of a volatile urban environment and cultivate strategies for reclaiming land and plants that are legally and culturally defined as wasted? In early 2022, the author began working with the community of the Bethnal Green Nature Reserve to collaboratively organise an experimental ecology survey of the site. The botany team, formed by Chiara Famengo and the author, set out to produce a living archive of the plant-life and plant knowledge of the site that emphasised not only the important work they do to care for the reserve, but also the ways in which the reserve takes care of them (emotionally, spiritually, mentally, and physically). To this end, the team experimented with walks and workshops as alternative ways of sharing and recording knowledge around often-overlooked urban plants (weeds) that engage with the ecological, social, and personal dimensions of the space. The Reserve exists in the context of a volatile and ever-changing urban environment, where the threat of future redevelopment casts a long shadow over any patch of grass or (waste)land in London. Whether it is council-owned or community-run, including the Bethnal Green Nature Reserve, the living archive of plant knowledge that they have built over the past few months is not only an educational toolkit but also a record of these plants’ ecological and social significance (through documenting people’s memories, recipes, remedies, and folklore attached to certain species) that will help them fight for the future of the site.",
"authorBio": "Ailo Ribas is a writer, researcher, and community organiser whose work straddles trans organising, dissident ecologies, folk knowledge, language, and mythology. She graduated with an MA from the Centre for Research Architecture at Goldsmiths University in 2022. In 2023, together with Areej Ashhab and Gabriella Demzcuk, she co-founded Al-Wah'at, an artist-research collective committed to countering harmful anthropocentric and colonial narratives around arid lands and futures, and to cultivating communal practices of care and repair in ecologies deemed ‘wastelands’. Their long-term project, Wild Hedges, studies the ecological and sociopolitical complexities of the prickly pear cactus and the cochineal insect across multiple geographies and temporalities, including Palestine, Mexico and Spain. It has garnered international recognition, receiving the PRIX COAL in 2023. Her debut book _The Fast-growing Stinking Escaped Waste-loving Wall-breaching Self-cloning Other-than-natural No-man’s Tree_, co-written with Ashhab, was published by Sharjah Art Foundation in 2024. She is a 2025 resident at the Jan van Eyck Academie, together with the rest of the collective.",

"content": "This essay presents the idea that the current understanding of ‘sustainability’ in the built environment is limited and flawed, as it exclusively supports the neoliberal elite interests while marginalizing community voices. The author examines how the dominant green building assessments, such as the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED® rating system, sustains the prevailing models of neoliberal urban design. Drawing on Gramsci's theory of cultural hegemony, the essay analyses the Hudson Yards redevelopment in Manhattan, New York City, as a case study to demonstrate how LEED® is used to maintain the current status quo and perpetuate existing power structures. The essay concludes by arguing that true sustainability in the climate era requires a shift away from the narrow, elite-driven interpretation of sustainability and towards a more inclusive, community-driven approach to design and architecture.",

"content": "It’s a well-founded fear; the older neighbourhoods of Dubai, which have been affordable spaces for middle-class South and Southeast Asians for over fifty years, are undergoing massive transformation and physical redevelopment. This redevelopment is occurring in the context of fewer affordable living alternatives for middle-class dwellers in Dubai. Yet, the transformation of these neighbourhoods extends beyond direct interventions in the built environment, such as redevelopment, inflation, and evictions. Physical redevelopment is fed by and feeds cultural expulsion in a now-smooth choreography. Cultural expulsions encapsulate an erasure of existing modes of living and being that support community, organic to the neighbourhood, and a rewriting of a space’s narrative through redevelopment and adjacent projects. As we witness more part-fictional reconstructions of the past like Al Seef, and the old-looking new souq in Deira (part of the Deira Enrichment Project), the stories of neighbourhoods like Bur Dubai, Deira, Satwa, and Karama are under threat of being reduced to glimpses of old souqs and dhows, with their residential, non-consumable, and transnational components rendered largely invisible. Since Dubai depends quite heavily on foreign direct investment and tourism for its sources of income, the Brand Dubai narrative needs to consistently reflect certainty, clarity, and profitability. These requirements barely leave room for the type of complex, messy historical cosmopolitanism housed in these neighbourhoods.",

"content": "Cairo, in its long history, has undergone a series of massive transformations that have sought to reconcile its proximity to the Nile river with its surrounding desert. Its current urban form is defined by these two geographical features: an old urban core setback from the river, and a modern city that continues to expand along its banks. Following the 1952 military takeover, the abolition of the monarchy, and the withdrawal of British occupying forces, successive regimes ushered in an era of expansion into the desert. Numerous settlements and cities were constructed to escape the confines of the Nile Valley. Many of these projects never materialised, and those that were built failed to achieve their objective of replacing the capital city. The period following the failed 2011 uprising marks a moment of transformation at an unprecedented scale. Against this backdrop, the essay interrogates these new conditions. It opens with two personal scenes drawn from site visits to two ongoing developments: the Maspero development in downtown Cairo, resulting in the destruction of a once cherished traditional, albeit informal, neighbourhood; and the construction of a ‘new city’ to the east—the New Administrative Capital (NAC). Together, these scenes foreground the themes of violence and escape, understood as modern urban conditions that exist in varying formations worldwide. The essay then situates Cairo’s historical development through David Harvey’s construct of “creative destruction”, alongside Timothy Mitchell’s argument that autocratic regimes dismantle the past in order to establish a new beginning, engaging with the broader notion of “urban violence.” The main body examines the two case studies in detail, analysing their physical characteristics and wider implications on Cairo’s urban landscape. The final section considers possible futures for the city through the construct of “Egyptianization”, demonstrating that Cairo’s residents are not passive but possess the capacity to resist, transform, and reshape the city.",

"content": "This essay presents a historical analysis of the educational system in Palestine, focusing on the story of Ramallah Friends School and its founders, Miriam Karam and the Quakers Eli and Sybil Jones. The narrative begins with Miriam's request to the Quakers in 1869 to establish an all-girls school in Ramallah guided by Quaker principles, which would later become the Ramallah Friends School. The essay situates the school within broader colonial and missionary educational frameworks, examining how institutions such as the Rosary Sisters School, the Orthodox School sought to produce a ‘civilised’ Palestinian citizenry while advancing foreign religious morals and principles. The essay follows the archival traces of the school's history, exploring its spatial and social evolution and the cultural perception of the school over time. The author uses photographs from the Palestinian Museum Digital Archive to document the school's past, engaging in a non-linear historical practice that encompasses the relationships and encounters with the teachers, syllabi, and spaces deployed for learning and knowledge production. Newsletters, Curricula and photographs reveal how the school produced “educated subjects” within these structures, yet also document strategies of resistance. The essay highlights how the Friends School simultaneously functioned as an instrument of colonial authority and a site of enduring Palestinian agency and community formation.",

"content": "The essay begins from a simple provocation: what happens when we take stray cats seriously as urban actors in the Gulf? Through “cat walks”—slow evening walks through neighborhoods attentive to feline presence—it explores how migration, home-making, and belonging in the UAE are produced through multispecies relations of care. Focusing on Bu Danic, a dense Sharjah neighborhood in the midst of demographic transition, the essay traces how cats move alongside migrant lives, anchoring continuity even as people, businesses, and rents shift around them. Drawing on ethnographic encounters with human and nonhuman residents, the essay reveals how everyday acts of feeding, sheltering, and cohabiting with cats create micro-architectures of care: fragile, improvised infrastructures that extend domestic life into streets and alleyways. These practices generate forms of interethnic sociality and political subjectivity that unsettle dominant portrayals of Gulf cities as transient, apolitical, or purely car-bound. Rather than reading care for cats as sentimental or marginal, the essay treats it as a quiet insistence on presence—a way of taking up space and making home under conditions of precarity. Attending to cats, as the essay argues, allows us to see Gulf urban life otherwise: as shaped by multispecies attachments that endure, adapt, and persist amid ongoing transition.",

"content": "South Korea emerged as a significant exporter of popular culture after the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, and numerous studies have shown the growing capacity of its soft power. The increase in foreign tourism, rising numbers of Korean-language learners, and ascending recognition by Western institutions have dominated the cultural industry for the past decades. K-towns, too, have evolved to become a cultural platform for the Korean government and Korean corporations to market the nation and its brands for economic and political benefit. This essay situates the contemporary branding of one such key neighbourhood in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, Bom Retiro, as “Little Seoul” within the broader rise of this power and nation-branding strategies. Drawing on the personal narrative of the author as a Korean-Brazilian, the essay traces how Hallyu has reshaped global perceptions of Korean identity and material landscapes of Bom Retiro and how South Korea has invested in Koreatowns worldwide as an element of their growing soft power strategy. The essay argues that the institutionalisation of this neighborhood risks reducing Bom Retiro to a singular ethnic narrative and threatens to erase other communities whose labour and histories have shaped the area. Through the case of AIGO, a diasporic bookstore, the essay proposes an alternative model of belonging grounded in collaboration and everyday practice.",

"content": "Over the last two decades – and in particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic – our patterns of life have changed so profoundly that architecture has struggled to keep pace. The apparent refuge of the home has become inseparable from the immense economical, technological, and political structures that have been shaping it since the Industrial Revolution, exposing carefully crafted top-down strategies that, perpetuated by pervasive processes of social calcification, have produced the domestic spaces we inhabit today. In an attempt to undo some of the more tangible consequences of those systemic practices, this essay places domestic space and communal structures at the centre of the social debate in architecture, harnessing the growing and transformative power of non-regulated collective action and bottom-up initiatives to subvert the current neoliberal real estate logics and envision alternative futures for our domestic aggregations. The proposal delves into the heterogeneity of households and proves a multiplicity of domestic meanings, with the aim of producing useful and operative knowledge related to a wide range of issues affecting communities and urban systems. The essay is thus an invitation to reflect on how we might imagine and inhabit our inherited domestic spaces otherwise, and how we come together beyond the effects of past and future global crises, when new forms of conviviality and care can arise and be exercised.",
"authorBio": "Marcos Parga, PhD, is an international, award-winning architect and designer, Assistant \nProfessor at Syracuse University School of Architecture, and founding principal of MAPAa \nEstudio, a design practice based in Syracuse, NY (USA) and Madrid (Spain). His research explores alternative ways of practising and evaluating the architecture of the collective, considering the impact of contemporary environmental, political, economic, and social issues on the built environment and its influence on creating the appropriate conditions for certain social changes to occur. His current work explores emerging models of urban commons and new forms of shared domesticities, questioning the political role of architects in shaping those alternative realities. Professor Parga has been a visiting critic and lecturer at various universities, works as a writer on architecture theory and criticism, and was the promoter and editor in chief of the academic and research journal _115Días_ (2014-17).

"content": "This essay examines the production of a public space in Abu Dhabi, the Sheikh Hazza Mosque Park, commonly known as Electra Park. In challenging portrayals of Gulf cities as lacking true public spaces, this essay begins with the research experiences of Yusril Nurhidayat, who witnesses a variety of recreational activities and users in the park, including local residents engaged in leisure pursuits and delivery workers taking a break from their assignments. Interestingly, Yusril is approached by an Ethiopian woman who is seeking assistance with a computer-based job assessment. She explains that she has lived in Abu Dhabi for five years and has previously worked as a hostess, front desk receptionist, and waitress, but has recently lost her job and is in need of a new one in order to maintain her visa. The park bench where she and Yusril are sitting has become her designated \"spot\" in Abu Dhabi, where she goes every day to smoke, drink coffee, and connect with her family back home. This opening anecdote offers an entry point into how city-dwellers define, appropriate, and use urban public and green spaces. While the park operates as a recreational environment, it becomes clear through observations and interviews that the park also functions as a site of transit, labour and informal social infrastructure. This essay argues that such “infrastructures of serendipity” are central to understanding how public space in Abu Dhabi is actively produced through lived experiences at the intersection of nationality, race, class, and gender as well as environmental factors in the climate of the UAE.",

"content": "The essay reflects on the development of Regenerative Design, an undergraduate architecture elective taught at the American University of Sharjah during my tenure as Faculty Fellow (2024–2025). The course emerged in response to the ecological dissonance between green rhetoric and extractive urban realities. Drawing from practice-based research—most notably the Tarabot Interspecies Pavilion and ReRoot, a bio-shelter for displaced communities—the elective explored regenerative design as a framework for cultivating environmental and multispecies literacy through posthumanist pedagogy. The essay situates teaching as a site of experimentation, where design and research feed each other in real time. Students engaged in lexicon-building, site sensing, and interspecies rendering to co-develop a landscape architecture intervention named Rawdah. Woven into an existing underused plaza in the heart of campus, Rawdah is designed to support both human and parahuman needs through modular, palimpsestic layering and local material experimentation. By blending ecological theory with speculative design and embodied fieldwork, the course challenged linear pedagogies and reframed architecture as a relational, regenerative practice. This essay argues that architectural education—particularly in the Gulf—must move beyond sustainability rhetoric and embrace design as a living system that is place-based and accountable to the futures it helps shape.",

"content": "This essay focuses on migrant urbanism in the Gulf region. Urbanism is understood as the way we live in our cities, defined by daily activity patterns. Building on a series of studies conducted by the authors in Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates since 2006, this essay examines how the spatial patterns of housing dynamics amongst migrant-majority populations in the Gulf have produced three very distinctive neighbourhood typologies: high-density urban blocks, low-rise compounds, and waterfront developments. All three typologies have had a major impact on daily commuting patterns, local economic development, and broader production of social segregation in Gulf cities. As large percentages of urban populations in Gulf cities consist of migrants with temporary residency status, housing has been supplied to cater to essential daily needs and less informed by specific demands, especially in the case of low to medium income groups. Based on these findings, this essay discusses the implications of migrant urbanism for environmental, economic, and social sustainability. It concludes by considering how architects, urban planners, and designers alike may foster more sustainable neighborhoods in the Gulf.",

"content": "The neoliberal 1980s are celebrated as Brisbane’s urbane coming-of-age as a cosmopolitan, global city, a transformation symbolised by the two mega events that bookended the decade: the 1982 Commonwealth Games and World Expo 88. Journalists and scholars alike revel in explaining the virtue of how this subtropical Australian city was rapidly transformed from a big-country-town into an international capital of leisure. In contrast to the triumphal narrative associated with these events, especially the latter, their impact on existent communities and neighbourhoods is seldom considered. Through interviews, focus groups and ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Brisbane between 2017 and 2018, the essay examines how neighbourhoods were directly affected by Expo 88, how some of the most vulnerable and marginalised populations were displaced, and how these neighbourhoods were recast as sites of consumption and leisure. While their voices were largely inaudible at the time, their protests are captured in the memories of long-time residents and the protest films and essays of the alternative press. In view of the Brisbane 2032 Olympic Games, the essay urges one to engage critically with the social legacies of these past mega-events not only to understand the contemporary urban fabric of the city, but also to ensure the social legacy of this future mega-event is not overlooked.",

"content": "Centred between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, Al Rahba City extends over 12 kilometres parallel to the E11 Road. Like its neighbouring cities, Al Rahba, which translates to ‘the vast land’, was built on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi in the early 1990s under the patronage of the late Sheikh Zayed. The city is linearly split into two: residential superblocks along the highway with granted houses as expansive as mansions and a grid of farms on the northern side. In terms of scale and spatial hierarchy, Al Rahba City functions essentially as a neighbourhood; one that lacks a ‘social nucleus’ or a sufficient social infrastructure catered to the community. While municipal attempts at improvement, such as a public park and public transport were implemented, socio-cultural demands remain only partially met. The ladies’ park continues to operate, but many urban spaces have been left underutilized or neglected. In attempts to uncover interrelated environmental, social, and architectural issues, this essay illustrates the present-day reality of the city through the lens of the author, a native resident. The essay visually and verbally narrates the story of the city from 1998–2022 in parallel to the author’s life stages as she comes of age, shedding light on the female experience in such a city model. Focusing on the privacy of walled homes, the majlis as a node of social community, and public institutions such as the Al Rahba School and the Al Sharia Park for Ladies and Children, the essay illuminates how access to public facilities remains limited for women.",

"content": "The rapid urbanisation and development of Gulf cities, driven by oil and gas discovery, has fostered a car-centric culture and limited access to public transport to its residents. This essay examines Muwaileh, a neighbourhood in Sharjah that was once peripheral and industrially adjacent and is now a residential area for expatriates. The area is marked by limited infrastructures and services, surrounded by high-traffic roads, and affected by the deterioration of buildings and architectural quality. Using observational, mapping, and sketching methods, the essay critically examines the urban fabric of Muwaileh, highlighting the social and environmental issues that arise due to limited access to amenities, lack of public spaces and local identity. The essay foregrounds latent ecologies, appropriation and improvisational inhabitation as key forces shaping everyday urban experience. Building on these insights, “Muweilah-scaping” is proposed as a speculative approach to reframe Muweilah’s future, connecting green spaces, enhancing walkability, and acknowledging the interplay between built and ecological systems.",

"content": "This paper investigates the significance of alleys in urban form, focusing on Abu Dhabi and Dubai as case studies. Although alleys have existed in the urban fabric since antiquity and served a wide range of purposes, they have often been neglected in urban analysis. The author maps the morphologies of alleys across different growth phases of the neighbourhood samples in both cities and identifies ten types of alleys. The results show that alleys play an important role in the urban fabric, serving as green infrastructure, public spaces, or thoroughfares that can improve access to destinations, with some alleys matching or even surpassing streets in pattern, density, and length. The author recommends acknowledging the value of alleys and utilising them as a critical element of urban form, especially at the neighbourhood scale.",

"content": "This essay highlights the importance of considering local urban ecologies, their specimens, and the entanglements in the development of integral plans that incorporate the different scales in critical conflict. Using three case studies from France, the US, and Chile, it examines the negative consequences of ignoring community relationships in the built environment. The case of a social housing program in Temuco, Chile, developed in the 90s without consideration for the inhabitants or their cultural codes, is also used to show ongoing efforts to repair the relationship between human settlements and more-than-human variables. Thus, Ivry-sur-Seine, Temuco, and New York serve as a framework to rethink the contemporary city and the importance of considering both human and more-than-human relationships in the production of the built environment.",

"content": "Most of the native citizens in the UAE live in public or private single-family houses. Given the tremendous cost of developing this type of housing and the inability to provide single-family houses for all current and future public housing needs, high-rise residential buildings seem to offer an alternative. But the question is, does this type of housing suit the local communities in the UAE, especially in light of the failure of previous Western experiences? Addressing this question, this essay proposes a community-oriented design for high-rise residential buildings in the UAE. It first investigates the community-relevant shortcomings of the traditional high-rise residential developments in the West. It then reviews the status quo of the recently built high-rise residential buildings in the UAE, where little attention has been given to the community needs. In an effort to find an answer to this problem, the essay examines four recent design experiences as examples of current global efforts to design community-responsive high-rise residential developments. Some conceptual approaches are derived from these experiences that are envisaged to help reach an approach for the case of the UAE. Nonetheless, because of the unique social and cultural traits of the UAE native society, one cannot rely on these global conceptual approaches alone. Instead, the essay proposes an approach that integrates relevant global experiences with the vertical reconfiguration of the idea of the ‘fareej’ as the smallest unit in the residential urban context both traditionally and in the future official urban plans in the UAE.",

"content": "Sharjah’s urban fabric comprises six main land uses that barely blend beyond their spatially incongruous boundaries: 1) low- rise, single-family residential; 2) low/mid-rise, multi-family residential; 3) high-rise, multi-family residential; 4) an educational zone (i.e. University City); 5) an industrial zone; and 6) a heritage district now part of the Heart of Sharjah. This essay examines the distribution of public open space (POS) typologies across all residential land uses in Sharjah. Selecting five sites across Sharjah for analysis, this essay aims to answer the following questions: What are the typologies of POS in Sharjah? What are the socio-spatial disparities with regards to access to POS within the city’s urban fabric? And what spatial interventions are needed to help reach environmental justice? This essay unpacks these questions by analysing the various typologies of POS in Sharjah and assessing accessibility and walkability to allotments of POS using a space syntax model, illustrating the spatial equity in distribution of POS. Through an environmental justice approach, this essay assesses the defining characteristics, distribution, and accessibility of the study area(s) as well as a computational analysis of GIS data. A scan of the existing conditions shows that POS infrastructure is sparsely provided across all land uses in the form of district and neighbourhood parks. By addressing these questions, the essay highlights the impact of planning process(es) on the livability and social sustainability of Sharjah, especially in light of the city’s growing population and the resultant growing need for access to public open spaces.",

"content": "This essay explores the relationship between urban planning and design and social cohesion in multicultural cities, with a specific focus on four selected neighbourhoods in Dubai: Bur Dubai, Deira, International City, and The Greens. Through a mixed-methods approach, the essay incorporates quantitative, qualitative, spatial, and observation analysis to examine the impact of physical neighbourhood factors on social cohesion. This essay further examines the role of various stakeholders in building socially cohesive neighborhoods, including local authorities, developers, urban planners, architects, researchers, community managers, and residents themselves. In doing so, the essay emphasises the role of urban planning and design in promoting social cohesion, particularly in multicultural cities like Dubai where diversity can provide opportunities for residents to enhance their social networks and strengthen their sense of community. Furthermore, the essay highlights the need to foreground the human scale in the process of urbanisation and urban sprawl, as people and their social interactions are central to the formation of socially cohesive neighborhoods. Overall, the essay provides valuable insights into the importance of considering the physical planning of built forms, layout, and design in the creation of socially cohesive neighbourhoods in an urban context.",

"content": "Spatial transformations driven by a complex of social and economic factors have profoundly altered the urban topography in Hyderabad, India’s fifth-largest city and fourth-largest urban agglomeration. Chief among the forces was the liberalization of the Indian economy in the early 1990s to attract foreign investments. The growth of disconnected, exclusive neighborhoods and gated communities which followed was driven by the spurt of the service industry in an effort to attract large corporations to set up their office campuses as a new force for economic development. The deluge of 1908, which struck the historic city of Hyderabad after it had long outgrown its walled boundaries, prompted a concerted effort in the planning and design of civic areas, parks, neighborhoods, and public spaces sensitive to their location and topography. In contrast, recent planning initiatives focus on land use and zoning primarily as a tool to upgrade the built environment for reasons of economic growth and financial profit, thereby alienating the inhabitants socially and economically. A distinct lack of legal tools to regulate this expansion has further aggravated the existing socio-spatial inequality within the city. This essay traces the planning and design trajectory of the city to expose the challenges within the logic of the new planning framework which results in the inequitable distribution and allocation of the urban commons. Through a comparative analysis of the old and new neighborhoods, it highlights the dissimilarities in their design that undermine affordability and accessibility for the majority of the citizens. Using the progressive rationale of early 20th century planning initiatives, which responded to the questions of resilience and sustainability, the essay points to the possible lessons that can inform our current planning policy and frameworks, and support the transformation towards a more just city.",

While efficient waste infrastructure is crucial to the day-to-day operations of the city, the workers who perform this labour largely remain invisible within the architectural and spatial arrangements of urban life. \n\nThe essay explores this relationship between the body and spatiality in regards to the socio-political context through the study of Zandy Sherman’s Infrastructures and the Ontological Question of Race and Steven Jackson’s, Speed, Time, Infrastructure: Temporalities of Breakdown, Maintenance, and Repair. Drawing on studies conducted by Anthropologist Waqas Butt, it examines the intersections of caste, religion and sanitary labour that are unique to the Pakistani context, including the material and spatial realities of workers’ settlements in Katchi Abadis. The essay also presents narratives of the workers and their families to elaborate the circumstances under which they are expected to work. While the labour of waste workers is essential to the living and breathing organism of the city, their bodies are deemed polluting to the urban fabric. Waste work, in this case, mobilizes the flow of discarded substances just as it regulates the flow of bodies in and around the city.",

"content": "Taking Sharjah as its site of study, this essay discusses how inhabitants of a city create spaces of identity and belonging by performing practices in different urban spaces. First, the essay introduces the concept of the city as a ‘category of practice’, offering the opportunity to observe people’s relationship to urbanisation processes. Subsequently, the essay situates the concepts of ‘practice’ and ‘space-place’ as mediums to exhibit inner realities (interventions) that describe how things interact and coordinate in the micro-scale realm, while manifesting external realities that become part of the cultural identity and visual discourse of urban Sharjah, and, in turn, how these concepts enable inhabitants to create a sense of belonging and develop urban memories. Anchored in three observations from different individuals documenting three practices in diverse locations in the Emirate of Sharjah, the essay reflects on how the design process should include and respond to those individuals affected by our interventions and, thus, our decisions. Finally, the essay introduces a series of guiding questions for decision-makers and the public to inform their practice. In critiquing interpretations of practice-space-place and the city, this essay aims to reduce the privileged discourse that might delegitimise other narratives.",

"content": "Though originally planned as a space for industry and manufacturing, Sharjah’s central industrial district has become a space for dwelling, a village unto itself. The districts, defined by zoning ordinances, are adjacent to, but segregated from, the residential areas of the city. What was then a peripheral area of urban Sharjah is now a centrally located district, as the city has grown and engulfed the original manufacturing and logistical zones. \n\nFor over forty years, Sharjah’s central industrial areas accommodated a mix of production and housing and they have been infused with complex layers of informal infrastructure that other more rapidly developed and tightly regulated residential and commercial districts lack. Districts, though relatively inhospitable and extremely underserved in terms of social infrastructure, have become mixed-use neighbourhoods with barbershop saloons, restaurants, tea houses, and convenience stores nestled between the factories and warehouse buildings. In response to a lack of public amenities, open spaces, and space for leisure, the working class residents of Sharjah’s industrial zones have altered and re-inhabited the fabric of the contemporary city. With limited means, residents have constructed, developed and inhabited an informal layer of commercial and leisure spaces between factories and in vacant lots at the urban core of the city. Through these appropriations of interstitial and peripheral zones by the working class, this essay highlights both the challenges and latent opportunities for designers and policy makers seeking to foster a more dynamic, socially just, and sustainable urbanism in Sharjah.",

"content": "The creation of the State of Greater Lebanon in 1920 resulted in significant changes to the country's borders, and ultimately challenged the notion of territory in Lebanon. Through the years, including during and after the civil war of 1975, the political instability and foreign occupations resulted in the blurring of the idea of neighbourhood and community. Newly imposed military boundaries, impacted the identity of the country and caused division among the Lebanese population.\n\nToday, Lebanon is facing multiple crises, including economic decline and mass destruction following the August 4th, 2020 Beirut port explosion. Across four interrelated scales, this essay examines how the social and political effects of the built environment, particularly in Beirut, are redefining the country's map and how the boundary changes over time through an individual's memory, events, and social practices. \n\nThe essay also investigates the scale of buildings and undesignated public spaces that have emerged as crucial sites of social life, contributing to the vitality of the dynamic neighbourhood life, providing insight into the tracing and traces of Beirut. By exploring these discrete but intersecting scales of socio-spatial experience, this essay demonstrates how boundary negotiations play a constant, if complex, role in the lived experience of contemporary Beirut.",
