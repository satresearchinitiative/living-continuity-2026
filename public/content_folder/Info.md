## Living Continuity

Living Continuity, is a collective inquiry into the challenges, urgency, and potential of working towards spatially just neighbourhoods. In current urban policy debates, the neighbourhood has emerged as an important scalar construct to understand the systems and processes that shape communities and ecosystems. This calls for re-examining the denotations and connotative dimensions of the terms ‘neighbourhood’, and ‘community’ beyond the romanticised and the normative. In the global context of pervasive neoliberal urbanism, cities that are planned and grow on principles of zoning warrant accelerated segregation, expulsion, and homogenisation. Urban expansion and renewal thus yields disproportionate access to and distribution of environmental wellness, urban commons, social health, and mobility. The tension between renewal and expansion which occurs at this scalar level also raises questions on how to secure lived continuity, intersectional diversity, and social cohesion. How can interlocutors, respondents, and residents facilitate and advocate for inclusive, decolonial, and sensitised discourses around urban policy and education given socio-political limitations and challenges?

## Glossary

Using language as a central lens through which *Living Continuity* has progressed, this *Glossary* exercise brings together key terms that have emerged from our research as recurring socio-urban concepts in a cosmopolitan context such as Sharjah. The selected words are presented in the eight most widely spoken languages in Sharjah. You are invited to engage with these terms, reflect on how they resonate personally, and consider how you may interpret them. This could be a personal memory, a story that comes to mind, an image, or even a feeling.

## Kit Of Parts

Rather than treating housing as a finished product, *Kit Of Parts* approaches it as a flexible system that can be adjusted, reassembled, and rethought by its users. Architect Marcos Parga develops a modular logic for a house, producing iterations of what a single dwelling can be, depending on how its components are put together. SAT Research invites this thinking into a different yet similar context and how it resonates in Sharjah. You are invited to engage with a hands-on activity kit to remove, fold, and assemble individual components labeled with a function such as kitchen, bedroom, bathroom using dotted lines and arrows. The resulting forms are simply boxes but prompt larger questions: How do you imagine spaces responding to daily activities? Rather than simply adapting to what is already built, can we imagine a future in which its users play an active role in designing their homes? This iteration offers a digital interface, welcoming you to interact with the modular elements on-screen.
